# Day-38 Workout Tracker (G-Sheet)

## Post-25 Day-38

🌟 Day 38 of 100 Days of Code: Workout Tracking with Google Sheets 🏋️‍♂️📊

Today, I combined the power of natural language processing, APIs, and Google Sheets to create a Workout Tracking App. This project was an incredible way to explore how technology can help automate fitness tracking and simplify everyday tasks.

Day 38 Highlights

🛠 Goals for the Day: Build an app that logs workout data into Google Sheets using APIs.

Key Lessons and Projects

- 1️⃣ API Credentials & Google Spreadsheet Setup:
  - Configured API access and created a dedicated Google Spreadsheet for tracking workouts.

- 2️⃣ Exercise Stats with Natural Language Queries:
  - Used APIs to fetch workout stats by simply typing natural language inputs like "ran 5km" or "lifted weights for 30 minutes."

- 3️⃣ Integrating with Sheety:
  - Set up Sheety to streamline data storage and interaction with Google Sheets.

- 4️⃣ Saving Data into Google Sheets:
  - Automated the process of logging workout stats directly into a spreadsheet with a simple API call.

- 5️⃣ API Authentication with Sheety:
  - Secured the API with proper authentication for reliable data handling.

- 6️⃣ Environment Variables:
  - Learned how to securely store API keys and sensitive information using environment variables. 🔒
