# Day-20-21 Snake Game

## Post-8 Day-20 to 21

ðŸŒŸ My Journey: Days 20â€“21 of 100 Days of Code ðŸŒŸ

Continuing to relive my Python journey from 100 Days of Code, hereâ€™s what I accomplished in Days 20â€“21:

Day 20: Snake Game Part 1 - Animation & Coordinates

- Set up the game screen and created the snake's body
- Animated the snake segments to move seamlessly on the screen
- Built a Snake Class to manage the snakeâ€™s movement with OOP principles
- Enabled user control of the snake via keypress

Day 21: Snake Game Part 2 - Inheritance & List Slicing

- Explored Class Inheritance to enhance game components
- Detected collisions with food to grow the snake and update the score
- Added collision detection with walls and the snakeâ€™s tail for game over conditions
- Built a Scoreboard Class to display live scores
- Applied list slicing techniques to handle the snake's tail mechanics

âœ¨ Project: Snake Game â€“ A fully functional game with animations, scoring, and collision mechanics.

Reflection

Days 20â€“21 marked a significant milestone in my learning, as I transitioned from basic projects to a more complex, feature-rich game. This was a perfect demonstration of how Python concepts like OOP, list slicing, and inheritance can be brought together to create something fun and interactive.

ðŸ”œ Coming up next, Days 22â€“23, with even more exciting projects to share!
