# Cafe API

## Post-49 Day-66

🚀 Day 66 of #100DaysOfCode: Building My Own REST API! 🌍

APIs are the backbone of modern web applications, and today, I took a deep dive into RESTful routing by creating my very own API! From handling HTTP methods to testing with Postman, this day was all about structuring APIs efficiently.

Key Takeaways

- 🔹 Understanding REST: How APIs interact using standard HTTP methods
- 📡 GET Requests: Fetching single and multiple records (random & all cafes)
- 🛠 POST Requests: Adding new data (new cafe entry)
- ✏️ PATCH vs. PUT: Updating records efficiently
- 🗑 DELETE Requests: Removing records safely
- 📑 API Documentation: Making APIs easy to use and understand
