ðŸ“Š Day 75 of #100DaysOfCode: Analyzing Google Trends Data & Time Series Visualization! ðŸ“ˆ

Today, I explored Google Trends data and learned how to resample, clean, and visualize time-series data using Matplotlib and Pandas. Time-series analysis is essential for tracking trends, forecasting, and making data-driven decisions.

Key Takeaways from Todayâ€™s Learning:

- âœ… Explored Google Search Data: Analyzed trends in Tesla, Bitcoin, and Unemployment ðŸ“Š
- âœ… Resampled Time-Series Data: Cleaned and structured data for better analysis ðŸ“†
- âœ… Visualized Tesla Trends: Created line charts to track fluctuations in search interest ðŸ“ˆ
- âœ… Formatted Time Axes with Locators & DateFormatters: Improved readability of graphs
- âœ… Styled Bitcoin & Unemployment Charts: Used grid lines, markers, and colors to enhance data presentation ðŸŽ¨
