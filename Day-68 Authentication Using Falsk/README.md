## Post-51 Day-68

🔐 Day 68 of #100DaysOfCode: Implementing Authentication with Flask! 🔥

Today, I dived into user authentication, learning how to register, log in, and secure user data using Flask. Handling authentication properly is crucial for any web application, and I explored various techniques to make it robust.

Key Takeaways from Today’s Learning:

- ✅ User Registration & Login: Implemented a sign-up and authentication system
- 🔒 Encryption & Hashing: Secured passwords using Werkzeug hashing & salting
- 🛡 Flask-Login: Managed user sessions and authentication status
- 💡 Flask Flash Messages: Provided real-time feedback to users
