Day 7: Hangman

- Broke down a complex problem into a flowchart for better understanding
- Built the Hangman Game from scratch, including features for lives, guesses, and a seamless user experience
  - âœ¨ Project: Hangman Game â€“ A timeless classic brought to life with Python.

Day 8: Function Parameters & Caesar Cipher

- Learned about function inputs, positional/keyword arguments, and organizing code
  - âœ¨ Project: Caesar Cipher â€“ An interactive program for encrypting and decrypting messages.

Day 9: Dictionaries, Nesting, and the Secret Auction

- Mastered Python dictionaries and nesting
  - âœ¨ Project: Secret Auction Program â€“ A fun, anonymous bidding system powered by nested data structures.

Day 10: Functions with Outputs
