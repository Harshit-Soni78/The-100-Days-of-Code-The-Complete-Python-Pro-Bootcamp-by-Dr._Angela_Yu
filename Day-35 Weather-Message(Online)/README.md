🌟 Day 35 of 100 Days of Code: Exploring API Authentication and Sending SMS with Python 📲🔐

Another productive day as I ventured deeper into APIs, authentication, and automation! Today’s project centered around building a weather notification system and sending SMS alerts using Python.

Day 35 Highlights

🛠 Goals for the Day: Understand API authentication, work with environment variables for security, and send notifications via SMS/WhatsApp.

Key Lessons and Projects

- 1️⃣ API Authentication:
  - Explored why API authentication is essential and how to securely authenticate using API keys.

- 2️⃣ OpenWeatherMap API Challenge:
  - Integrated weather data to check if it will rain in the next 12 hours. ☔

- 3️⃣ Twilio API for SMS Alerts:
  - Sent automated weather updates via SMS. For those who can’t use SMS, explored the WhatsApp API as an alternative.

- 4️⃣ Environment Variables:
  - Learned how to hide sensitive API keys using environment variables for secure coding practices.

- 5️⃣ Automation with PythonAnywhere:
  - Deployed the Python script on PythonAnywhere to automate weather notifications. 🌐
