🏡 Day 81 of #100DaysOfCode: Predicting House Prices with Data Science 📊📈

Today’s milestone was all about building a predictive model for house prices—a crucial application of machine learning in the real world! Using historical data, I worked on training a model to estimate house prices based on various features like location, size, and amenities.

What I Accomplished Today:

- ✅ Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values & feature engineering 🛠️
- ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding patterns in the dataset 🔍
- ✅ Model Training & Evaluation – Implementing regression models 📉
- ✅ Performance Metrics – Measuring accuracy using RMSE & R² ⚡
- ✅ Insights & Learning Points – Key takeaways from the project 📑
