✈️ Days 39 & 40 of 100 Days of Code: Flight Deal Finder & Flight Club 💸🌍

I'm thrilled to share the culmination of another exciting chapter in my 100 Days of Code journey! Over these two days, I built a comprehensive Flight Deal Finder and Flight Club, combining multiple APIs and Google Sheets to create an automated system for finding and sharing travel deals.

Highlights of Days 39 & 40

Day 39: Flight Deal Finder

💡 Goals: Build a system to track flight deals and alert users when prices drop.

  - Used Amadeus API to fetch IATA codes for destinations.

- 3️⃣ Flight Price Comparison:
  - Built a system to search for cheap flights and compare them against stored prices.

- 4️⃣ Notifications:
  - Sent alerts via SMS/Email when a flight deal was better than the stored price.

Day 40: Flight Club

💡 Goals: Create a sharable flight deal service.

- 1️⃣ Sharable Form Setup:
  - Designed a form linked to a Google Sheet for users to join the flight club.
