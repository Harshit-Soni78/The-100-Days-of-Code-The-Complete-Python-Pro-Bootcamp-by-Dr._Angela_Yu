# Day-69 Blog Project Adding Users

## Post-52 Day-69

📝 Day 69 of #100DaysOfCode: Enhancing My Blog Project with User Authentication! 🚀

Today’s focus was on adding user authentication and authorization to my Flask-based blog project. This step ensures that users can register, log in, and interact with the blog securely.

Key Features Implemented Today:

- ✅ User Registration & Login: Built an authentication system to allow users to sign up and log in.
- 🔐 Protected Routes: Restricted access to certain pages based on authentication.
- 🗄 Relational Databases: Linked users to their blog posts and comments.
- 💬 User Comments: Enabled users to add comments to blog posts, enhancing interaction.

Why This Matters?

Building a blog isn’t just about displaying content—it’s about creating an interactive platform where users can engage. With authentication and user management, I’m making this project more dynamic and secure!

Next, I’ll be working on improving the UI and adding more functionalities. Stay tuned! 🚀
