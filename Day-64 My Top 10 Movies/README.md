# Day-64 My Top 10 Movies

## Post-47 Day-64

🎬 Day 64 of #100DaysOfCode: My Top 10 Movies Website! 🍿🎥

Today, I built a movie ranking web app using Flask, SQLite, and SQLAlchemy! Now, I can add, edit, delete, and rank movies in a fully functional database-driven web application.

What I Accomplished

- ✅ Created a movie list with dynamic database entries 🎞️
- ✅ Implemented CRUD functionality for adding/editing/deleting movies 📝
- ✅ Allowed users to rate and review movies ⭐
- ✅ Added sorting functionality to rank movies by rating 🔢
- ✅ Used Flask, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite for backend integration 🗄️
