ðŸŒŸ My Journey: Days 1â€“5 of 100 Days of Code ðŸŒŸ

After successfully completing the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu!" and sharing my certificate, Iâ€™m excited to reflect on and share the first steps of this transformative journey. ðŸš€

Day 1: Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data

This day was all about the basics:

- Understanding Pythonâ€™s console printing and string manipulation
- Learning variable declaration and naming rules
  - âœ¨ Project: Band Name Generator â€“ A fun start to Python programming!

Day 2: Understanding Data Types and Manipulating Strings

Key takeaways:

- Explored Pythonâ€™s primitive data types, type conversion, and mathematical operations
  - âœ¨ Project: Tip Calculator â€“ Perfect for simplifying bill-splitting scenarios!

Day 3: Control Flow and Logical Operators

This was the day to dive into decision-making in Python:

- Mastered `if/else`, conditional operators, and logical expressions
  - âœ¨ Project: Treasure Island Game â€“ A text-based adventure game that brought control flow to life!

Day 4: Randomisation and Python Lists

Hereâ€™s where things started to get dynamic:

- Learned about Pythonâ€™s `random` module, list indexing, and working with nested lists
  - âœ¨ Project: Rock Paper Scissors Game â€“ My first interactive game using randomisation.

Day 5: Python Loops

A day focused on automation and repetition:

- Mastered `for` loops, the `range()` function, and iterating over lists
  - âœ¨ Project: Password Generator â€“ A practical tool for creating secure, random passwords!
