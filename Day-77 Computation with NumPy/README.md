# Day-77 Computation with NumPy

## Post-60 Day-77

📊 Day 77 of #100DaysOfCode: NumPy & N-Dimensional Arrays! 🚀

Today, I explored NumPy, one of the most powerful libraries for scientific computing in Python. Working with N-dimensional arrays (ndarrays) allows for efficient data processing, making it essential for machine learning, image processing, and numerical computing.

Key Takeaways from Today’s Learning:

- ✅ Understanding NumPy's ndarray: The foundation of fast numerical computing in Python ⚡
- ✅ Generating & Manipulating ndarrays: Created arrays, reshaped data, and performed operations 🔢
- ✅ Broadcasting & Matrix Multiplication: Optimized array calculations for high-speed processing 🏎
- ✅ Manipulating Images as ndarrays: Processed images using NumPy’s array-based approach 🖼
