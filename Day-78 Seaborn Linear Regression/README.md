## Post-61 Day-78

📊 Day 78 of #100DaysOfCode: Linear Regression & Data Visualization with Seaborn! 🎬📈

Today, I explored Linear Regression and Data Visualization using Seaborn & Scikit-Learn! These tools are essential for data analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning. I worked with film industry data to uncover insights and trends.

Key Takeaways from Today’s Learning:

- ✅ Exploring & Cleaning Data: Identified missing values & anomalies 🔍
- ✅ Investigating Films with Zero Revenue: Filtered outliers and inconsistencies 🎬
- ✅ Filtering on Multiple Conditions: Analyzed international films 🌍
- ✅ Seaborn Data Visualization: Created bubble charts for intuitive insights 📊
- ✅ Floor Division Trick: Converted years into decades for trend analysis ⏳
- ✅ Plotting Linear Regressions with Seaborn: Visualized relationships between variables 🔄
- ✅ Using Scikit-Learn for Regression: Built and trained a predictive model 🤖
