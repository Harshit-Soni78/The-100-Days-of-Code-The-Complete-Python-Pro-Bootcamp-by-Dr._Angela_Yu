# The Quiz Game

## Post-5 Day-15 to 17

ðŸŒŸ My Journey: Days 15â€“17 of 100 Days of Code ðŸŒŸ

Continuing to share my progress from the 100 Days of Code. Here's what I tackled during Days 15â€“17:

Day 15: Local Development Environment Setup & Coffee Machine

- Learned how to set up a local development environment effectively
- Built a Coffee Machine Project, covering functional programming and modular code design
  - âœ¨ Project: Coffee Machine â€“ A console-based interactive coffee machine simulation.

Day 16: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Explored the power of OOP concepts like classes, objects, constructors, and methods
- Refactored the Coffee Machine into an OOP-based structure
  - âœ¨ Project: OOP Coffee Machine â€“ A redesigned, reusable, and scalable version of the Coffee Machine.

Day 17: The Quiz Project & Benefits of OOP

- Created a Quiz Application by mastering classes, attributes, and methods
- Integrated external data using Open Trivia DB to make the quiz dynamic
  - âœ¨ Project: Quiz Project â€“ A fully interactive quiz game with score tracking and question banks.

Looking Back

Days 15â€“17 were all about stepping into intermediate coding concepts, especially OOP, which has transformed how I approach problem-solving and program design.

ðŸ”œ Iâ€™ll continue sharing highlights from the remaining days and the amazing projects I built during this journey. Stay tuned for more updates!
