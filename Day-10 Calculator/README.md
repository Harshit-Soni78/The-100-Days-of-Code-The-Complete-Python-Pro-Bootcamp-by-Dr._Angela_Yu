## Post-3 Day-6 to 10

🌟 My Journey: Days 6–10 of 100 Days of Code 🌟

Continuing my reflection on the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu, here’s a look at the next set of challenges and milestones I accomplished. 🚀

Day 6: Python Functions & Karel

- Explored defining and calling Python functions
- Tackled hurdles with while loops and variable heights
  - ✨ Project: Escaping the Maze – A logic-packed challenge that tested my problem-solving skills!
  - In this I solved every stage of Reeborg's World Game.

Day 7: Hangman

- Broke down a complex problem into a flowchart for better understanding
- Built the Hangman Game from scratch, including features for lives, guesses, and a seamless user experience
  - ✨ Project: Hangman Game – A timeless classic brought to life with Python.

Day 8: Function Parameters & Caesar Cipher

- Learned about function inputs, positional/keyword arguments, and organizing code
  - ✨ Project: Caesar Cipher – An interactive program for encrypting and decrypting messages.

Day 9: Dictionaries, Nesting, and the Secret Auction

- Mastered Python dictionaries and nesting
  - ✨ Project: Secret Auction Program – A fun, anonymous bidding system powered by nested data structures.

Day 10: Functions with Outputs

- Explored functions with outputs, multiple return values, and Python docstrings
  - ✨ Project: Calculator Program – A simple yet versatile tool for performing calculations.
