## Post-20 Day-33

🚀 Day 33 of 100 Days of Code: Mastering APIs & Building an ISS Overhead Notifier 🌍🛰

APIs are the backbone of modern applications, and today, I dove deep into API endpoints, parameters, and responses while building some fun and practical projects!

Day 33 Highlights

🛠 Goals for the Day: Understand how APIs work, interact with API endpoints, parse responses, and build an ISS (International Space Station) Overhead Notifier!

Key Lessons and Challenges

- 1️⃣ What Are APIs?
  - Learned the basics of Application Programming Interfaces and how they enable interaction between software systems.

- 2️⃣ API Endpoints & Calls:
  - Explored how to make API requests and handle responses, including HTTP status codes and exceptions.

- 3️⃣ Fun Projects Built:
  - Kanye Quotes App: Fetches inspirational quotes from the Kanye Rest API—because wisdom can come from anywhere! 😉
  - ISS Overhead Notifier: Notifies when the ISS is overhead and the sky is clear to view it. A combination of API parameters, sunset data, and geolocation magic!
