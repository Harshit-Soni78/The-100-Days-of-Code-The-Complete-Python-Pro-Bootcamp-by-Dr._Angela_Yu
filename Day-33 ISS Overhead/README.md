# Day-33 ISS Overhead

## Post-20 Day-33

🚀 Day 33 of 100 Days of Code: Mastering APIs & Building an ISS Overhead Notifier 🌍🛰

APIs are the backbone of modern applications, and today, I dove deep into API endpoints, parameters, and responses while building some fun and practical projects!

Day 33 Highlights

🛠 Goals for the Day: Understand how APIs work, interact with API endpoints, parse responses, and build an ISS (International Space Station) Overhead Notifier!

Key Lessons and Challenges

- 1️⃣ What Are APIs?
  - Learned the basics of Application Programming Interfaces and how they enable interaction between software systems.

- 2️⃣ API Endpoints & Calls:
  - Explored how to make API requests and handle responses, including HTTP status codes and exceptions.

- 3️⃣ Fun Projects Built:
  - Kanye Quotes App: Fetches inspirational quotes from the Kanye Rest API—because wisdom can come from anywhere! 😉
  - ISS Overhead Notifier: Notifies when the ISS is overhead and the sky is clear to view it. A combination of API parameters, sunset data, and geolocation magic!

Reflection

Today’s journey was about turning data into action. Learning to integrate APIs into projects opens up endless possibilities—whether it’s real-time notifications, weather updates, or just fun apps like Kanye quotes!

APIs bring the world of information to your fingertips—what’s the coolest API project you’ve built? Let’s share and inspire each other!
