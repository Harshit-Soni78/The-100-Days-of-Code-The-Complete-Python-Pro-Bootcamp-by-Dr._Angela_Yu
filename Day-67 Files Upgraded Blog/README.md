🚀 Day 67 of #100DaysOfCode: RESTful Routing for My Blog! 📖

Today, I took my blog project to the next level by implementing RESTful routing, making it dynamic and interactive! Now, I can fetch, create, update, and delete blog posts using API endpoints.

Key Highlights from Today’s Learning

- ✅ GET Requests: Fetch and display blog posts dynamically
- ✍ POST Requests: Add new blog posts through API calls
- 🔄 PUT/PATCH Requests: Edit existing blog content
- 🗑 DELETE Requests: Remove blog posts when needed
