# Day-22 Pong Game

## Post-9 Day-22

ðŸŒŸ My Journey: Day 22 of 100 Days of Code ðŸŒŸ

Reliving Day 22 of my Python journey with 100 Days of Code. I dived into building one of the most iconic games of all time: Pong! ðŸŽ®

Day 22 Highlights: Build Pong â€“ The Famous Arcade Game

- Set up the Main Screen for the game
- Built a responsive Paddle Class for player controls
- Added a Ball Class to bring the game to life with motion
- Implemented logic for Ball Bouncing upon collisions
- Wrote code to detect:
  - Collisions between the ball and paddles
  - When the ball goes out of bounds
- Created a Score Keeping System and made the ball's speed dynamic

âœ¨ Project: Pong Game â€“ A complete arcade-style game featuring responsive paddles, bouncing mechanics, score tracking, and dynamic difficulty.

Reflection

Day 22 took me back to the roots of gaming! Building Pong helped me solidify my understanding of object-oriented programming, collision detection, and event-driven programming in Python. Each feature added more depth, making this project both challenging and rewarding.

ðŸ”œ Stay tuned for Day 23, where the learning continues!
