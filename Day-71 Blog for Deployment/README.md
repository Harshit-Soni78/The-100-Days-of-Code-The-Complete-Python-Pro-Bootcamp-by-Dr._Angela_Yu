🚀 Day 71 of #100DaysOfCode: Deploying My Web Application! 🌍

After weeks of coding, today I took a crucial step—deploying my web application! 💻 Learning how to take a project from local development to a live, accessible website is an essential skill for every developer.

What I Covered Today:

- ✅ Version Control with Git: Managed project history efficiently 🔄
- ✅ Environment Variables: Secured sensitive data 🔑
- ✅ WSGI Server with Gunicorn: Improved performance & scalability ⚙️
- ✅ GitHub for Remote Repositories: Seamless collaboration and backups 📂
- ✅ Hosting My Web App: Set up a live web service 🌎
- ✅ Upgrading SQLite to PostgreSQL: Made the database production-ready 🗄

Why Deployment is a Game-Changer?
A project isn’t complete until it’s accessible to users. Learning to deploy, configure databases, and manage a production server bridges the gap between coding and real-world applications!

🔥 Next step? Scaling and optimizing performance!
