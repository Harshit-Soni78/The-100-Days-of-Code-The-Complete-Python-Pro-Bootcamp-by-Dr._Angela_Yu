- Learning variable declaration and naming rules  
  ✨ Project: Band Name Generator – A fun start to Python programming!

Day 2: Understanding Data Types and Manipulating Strings

Key takeaways:

- Explored Python’s primitive data types, type conversion, and mathematical operations  
  ✨ Project: Tip Calculator – Perfect for simplifying bill-splitting scenarios!

Day 3: Control Flow and Logical Operators

This was the day to dive into decision-making in Python:

- Mastered `if/else`, conditional operators, and logical expressions  
  ✨ Project: Treasure Island Game – A text-based adventure game that brought control flow to life!

Day 4: Randomisation and Python Lists

Here’s where things started to get dynamic:

- Learned about Python’s `random` module, list indexing, and working with nested lists  
  ✨ Project: Rock Paper Scissors Game – My first interactive game using randomisation.

Day 5: Python Loops

A day focused on automation and repetition:

- Mastered `for` loops, the `range()` function, and iterating over lists  
  ✨ Project: Password Generator – A practical tool for creating secure, random passwords!
