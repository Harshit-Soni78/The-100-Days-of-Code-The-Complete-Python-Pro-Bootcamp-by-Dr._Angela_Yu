🧼 Day 80 of #100DaysOfCode: The Tragic Discovery of Handwashing – A Data Science Perspective 📊🩺

Today, I explored one of the most impactful discoveries in medical history—how handwashing reduced mortality rates in Vienna hospitals. Using t-tests and statistical distributions, I analyzed the life-saving effect of this simple yet powerful hygiene practice.

Key Insights from Today’s Learning:

- 📌 Data Exploration: Visualized birth & death rates at Vienna General Hospital 🏥
- 📌 Comparative Analysis: Split data by clinic to observe trends 📊
- 📌 Statistical Significance: Used t-tests to confirm the impact of handwashing 🔬
- 📌 Distribution Visualization: Explored mortality patterns over time 📈
- 📌 Real-World Impact: Highlighted how data-driven decisions shape public health 🌍
