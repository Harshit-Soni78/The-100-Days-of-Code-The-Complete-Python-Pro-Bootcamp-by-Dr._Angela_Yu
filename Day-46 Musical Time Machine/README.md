# Day-46 Musical Time Machine

## Post-29 Day-46

🎵 Day 46 of 100 Days of Code: The Musical Time Machine 🚀🎶

Ever wished you could travel back in time and listen to the hottest songs from any given year? That’s exactly what I built today—a Spotify playlist generator that scrapes Billboard’s Hot 100 and creates a playlist based on a user-specified date! 🔥

Key Learnings from Day 46

- ✅ Web Scraping Billboard’s Hot 100 using BeautifulSoup 📊
- ✅ Authenticating with Spotify API 🔑
- ✅ Searching Spotify for the top songs 🎼
- ✅ Creating & Adding Songs to a Playlist automatically 🎧

💡 How It Works:

Simply enter a date (e.g., your birth year or any memorable time), and the script fetches the top 100 songs from Billboard and creates a Spotify playlist—bringing the past to life!
