ðŸ§± Day 74 of #100DaysOfCode: Analyzing the LEGO Dataset with Pandas! ðŸ“Š

Today, I worked with real-world dataâ€”the LEGO datasetâ€”to practice data aggregation, merging, and visualization using Pandas. Analyzing datasets like this helps develop skills for data science and business analytics.

Key Takeaways from Todayâ€™s Learning:

- âœ… Explored LEGO Brick Colors: Analyzed unique colors across different sets ðŸŽ¨
- âœ… Found the Oldest & Largest LEGO Sets: Discovered historical LEGO trends ðŸ•°
- âœ… Visualized LEGO Set Releases Over Time: Used line charts to track growth ðŸ“ˆ
- âœ… Used Pandasâ€™ agg() Function: Aggregated data to find key insights ðŸ“Š
- âœ… Merged DataFrames & Created Bar Charts: Learned about relational databases, primary & foreign keys ðŸ”—
- âœ… Created Scatter Plots: Analyzed the average number of parts per LEGO set
